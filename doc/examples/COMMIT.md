# Commit command examples

`menderbot commit` was used to write the message for SHA `5ec33`... of this repo, using OpenAI gpt-4 model.

Here was it's initial output:

```md
Switch from pipenv to pip and venv for Python package management

* Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to replace `pipenv` with `pip`
* Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for new dependency installation and test running process
* Remove `Pipfile` used for `pipenv` environments
* Revise `README.md` for updated system requirements, project running, installation, and development
* Include instructions in `README.md` for using Python's `venv` module for virtual environments
```

Two of these seemed redundant and were manually removed, leaving this final commit messages.

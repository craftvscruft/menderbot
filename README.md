> The AI-powered command line tool for working with legacy code. Based on the principles of the [Mechanized Mending Manifesto](https://mender.ai/docs/intro).

## Status

Menderbot is usable in development of itself - a very small codebase. For instance, it's used on this project for first drafts of commit messages, it added most of the type annotations, and chat usually gives relevant answers. On codebases of an interesting size (> 10K lines) there is still much work to do.

## Commands implemented (-ish):

* `menderbot ask`: Ask a question about the codebase
* `menderbot chat`: Interactively chat about the codebase
* `menderbot commit`: Git commit the current changeset with a pre-populated commit message
* `menderbot diff`: Summarize the differences between two versions of a codebase
* `menderbot doc`: Generate documentation for the existing code (Python only)
* `menderbot review`: Review a code block or changeset and provide feedback
* `menderbot type`: Insert type hints (Python only)
* `menderbot ingest`: Index the current state of the repo for `ask` and `chat` commands

## System requirements

* git
* [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (for managing Python environments)
* C Compiler
* The environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to a valid OpenAI API Key.

## Developing

This project uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for the parser grammars, so you'll want to clone it this way.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:craftvscruft/menderbot.git
```

Then you can initialize the Python environment using pipenv.

```
pipenv shell
```
### Running

Install an editable version.
```
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then run with `menderbot`.

### Installing

Not yet supported, run within pipenv on a local checkout for now. Upvote this [issue](https://github.com/craftvscruft/menderbot/issues/1) if you're interested.

### Pre-commit

Formatting, linting, tests, and type-checking can all be run through pre-commit, configured in `.pre-commit-config`.

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Install this as a git hook with `pre-commit install`.

Or you can run individual steps

```
isort menderbot tests
black menderbot tests
pylint --disable=C,R menderbot
pytest
mypy
```
